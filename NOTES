My server was not hosting so was trying to delete server file and re do it again
then I ended up deleting my entire code, so re-starting it again.

keep getting -- at Function.listen (/Users/subashkhatri/Documents/server-calculator/node_modules/express/lib/application.js:618:24)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/subashkhatri/Documents/server-calculator/server/server.js:8:5)--
    on my server.

    after dealing wiith it almost entire day, come to find out 5000 would not work for my computer
    so I used 5001.

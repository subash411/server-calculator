My server was not hosting so was trying to delete server file and re do it again
then I ended up deleting my entire code, so re-starting it again.

keep getting -- at Function.listen (/Users/subashkhatri/Documents/server-calculator/node_modules/express/lib/application.js:618:24)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/subashkhatri/Documents/server-calculator/server/server.js:8:5)--
    on my server.

    after dealing wiith it almost entire day, come to find out 5000 would not work for my computer
    so I used 5001.
[x] fixed the port problem, had to go to preference and uncheck the airplay button under sharing folder.

    would display first and second number but does not show the total, it shows undefined.

    can not figure out why it would not add, subtract, multiply or divide and shows total.

[x] operator = $(this).text();
        console.log(operator); this code helped to do the calculation.
